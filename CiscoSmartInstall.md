# Cisco Smart Install
Cisco Smart Install is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch
deployment for new switches. This means that a customer can ship a switch to a location, place it in the
network and power it on with no configuration required on the switch.

###Enumeration/Exploit
If TCP port 4786 smart-install is open, Metasploit can be used to check if it's vulnerable and exploit

####Metasploit
```
msf> msfconsole -q
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/misc/cisco_smart_install
msf> set RHOSTS <ipaddress(es)>
msf> set ACTION DOWNLOAD
msf> run
```
This will fingerprint the system and verify it is a cisco switch with smart install running. ACTION DOWNLOAD will attempt to download the config file and crack the hashes found. If the config file is downloaded check `~/.msf4/loot` and verify the config file for the correct hash identification

####Smart Install Exploitation Tool
The [SIET](https://github.com/frostbits-security/SIET) was developed to exploit this vulnerability and allows you to abuse Cisco Smart Install.

`python2 siet.py [options] <ipaddress>`

This will work in the same sense as metasploit and pull the config file from the switch. siet.py will save the config file in the tftp folder for you to view. After the config file has been downloaded, read the file to find usernames and passwords or password hashes.



If SSH or a web client is open, attempt the credentials found from the smart install config file to log in to the switch
