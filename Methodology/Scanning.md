# Scanning

- When scanning a network range, it is important to conduct a ping sweep first in order to find live hosts. Without determining live hosts, network scans could take copious amounts of time (depending on the size of the network).

- When conducting a ping sweep, it is best to send the output of the scan to an nmap grepable file or a text file so that a live host file can be created based on the ping sweep and can be used during later scans.

- After creating a live host file, other scans can be conducted such at TCP/UDP, script, version, OS, etc.

- When conducting further scans, it is important to send the output to various file types such as gnmap, nmap, or xml. Having these files allows auditors to go back and read through these files, or to keep these files as findings or such. XML files are extremely important for other use!

- **Automation** of this entire phase is made easy with [discovery.py](https://github.com/DalekG/discovery.py "discovery.py")
  - Discovery.py will automate the scanning phase and create a livehost, csv, and xml outfile from the scans conducted.

- CSV files are important because they can easily organize scan information and add for easy collaboration with team members.

- XML files can be used to import scan outputs into metasploit.
  - To import data into metasploit, use `db_import /path/to/xml/file`
  - Once the xml file has been imported you can easily use [metasploit commands](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/exporting-and-importing-data/ "metasploit commands") to list services, hosts, creds, etc.
