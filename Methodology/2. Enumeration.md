# Enumeration
Having a CSV file will make a pentest easier when it comes to enumeration. After a CSV is created, you should be able to look through the different hosts and services and start to establish a baseline of the network.
  - Some questions to ask yourself should be:
    - What are the common services running?
    - What are the common ports open on similar OSs?
    - What are the versions of services running, and are they up-to-date?
    - What are the different OSs on systems?
    - How/Why are the different systems connected to each other?
    - What security/authentication mechanisms are in place and how can I bypass them?

Once you have a pretty good understanding of what is active and running on the network, it should be easy to pick out the things that are "weird". Weirdness should be things that stand out apart from the common services that are running.

Vulnerability scans can be essential to the enumeration phase. Conducting and reviewing vulnerability scans can help point out a lot of vulnerabilities that you may not catch just by looking at services that are shown from nmap. Nmap scripts, located in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`, can help enumerate different services. Metasploit auxiliary scanners can help enumerate a lot of different services as well. After importing the xml output from nmap, you can add hosts with ease to run aux scans against a large segment of hosts.

When all else fails, netcat and telnet can be useful when enumerating a lot of services. Simply by using `nc <ip-address> <port>` can possibly give useful information about the service and version that is running on that port.

After determining services and versions, you should be able to use a search engine to find vulnerabilities or PoCs for exploits on those. ExploitDB comes default with Kali and has a wide variety of listed vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used. **Be mindful that when using third party exploits, they should be reviewed and altered if need be before using against a live host**

To search ExploitDB's database, use `searchsploit <keyword(s)>`
