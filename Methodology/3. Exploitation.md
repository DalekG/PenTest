# Exploitation

Exploitation is always the most fun phase of penetration tests, this is when you will be actively trying to gain access to the systems that are within the scope of the pentest. It is important to remember that even though you really want to gain root/admin or even user level access to many machines, it can also be looked as a good thing if you are not able to. At the end of the day, as a penetration tester, it is our goal to help strengthen the defenses of networks. If you are unable to gain access, then you have still provided a great deal of help in keeping the company secure.

When exploiting systems Remote Code Execution (RCE), buffer overflows, insecure and misconfigured services, OS or harware vulnerabilities, and [default credentials](https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/) are exploits to try and target.
When exploiting web services SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Local File Inclusion (LFI), broken access controls, and default credentials are some exploits to try and target. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) maintains a good list of the top ten exploits used on web apps.

Before attempting to conduct exploits, it is important that you use a tool to check if there are vulnerabilities tied to the host or the services. There are plenty of tools that can help point out vulnerabilities on systems or applications out there for use, but a few that I enjoy are:
  - [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  - [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
  - [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
  - [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)
  - [wfuzz](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)

Exploits can be developed or found on-line. Most of the time you can look at the CVEs that are listed for the vulnerabilities and get pointed to a PoC or further information about the vulnerability. You could use search engines to search for `<CVE> proof of concepts` or `<service> exploits`

There are also all kinds of automation tools that help with exploitation such as:
  - Metasploit
  - Autosploit
  - PowerSploit
  - Cobalt Strike
  - BurpSuite
  - ZAP
  - sqlmap
  - Hydra
