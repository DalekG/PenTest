# Enumeration



## OLD
Once services, operating systems, web page services/versions are figured out, start
conducting research online to see if there are any known vulnerabilities on this stuff. If you find a
vulnerability for a service on the network, make sure to make note of it in a document.

Nmap does a decent job of enumerating versions of the different services running, but you can
use netcat or telnet to connect to any port on the network to attempt to banner grab.

Knowing what version of services running will help pin-point vulnerabilities or exploits during
enumeration.
