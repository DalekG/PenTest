# Port 9100 - jetdirect
Printers can contain a lot of useful information and often times contains information disclosures that could be useful for targeting attacks. If TCP port 9100 is open on printers, the printer can be exploited with either of the automation tools listed below. PRET will give full access to printers while PRETty is a good check when you have a mass list of printers.

## PRET.py
PRET can be used to exploit printers, one at a time, by allowing capturing or manipulating print jobs, accessing the printer's file system and memory, or causing physical damage to the device. PRET comes with a wide variety of commands, after successful connection to the printer with PRET use the `help` command to get the full list.

To install and use PRET:

Clone the PRET repository from Github\
	`git clone https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET`

Create an alias for pret.py\
	`alias pret=â€™python /path/to/pret.py'`

Install the requirements\
  	`pip install colorama pysnmp`

Hack away\
	`pret <ip-address> {ps, pjl, pcl}`


## PRETty.py
To automate checking if printers are vulnerable to PRET, use PRETty for a convenient CLI, non-interactive prompting experience.

Install and Use:

Clone PRETty repo from GitHub\
  	`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varens/PRETty`

Install the prerequisites\
  	`apt install imagemagick ghostscript`\
  	or\
  	`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create an alias\
  	`alias pretty='python path/to/PRETty.py'`
  
Hack away\
 	`pretty path/to/input/file --command pret_pagecount.txt --match_condition 'pagecount=\d+' > printer_list`
