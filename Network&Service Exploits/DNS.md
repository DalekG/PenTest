# Port 53 - Domain Name Service
DNS is basically the phone book of the internet. Users enter a domain name into the URL (https://example.com), but web browsers interact with information through IP addresses. DNS translates the domain name into an IP address so that browsers are able to interact with said data.

### DNS Records
A - Holds the IPv4 address of a domain\
AAAA - Holds the IPv6 address of a domain\
CNAME - Used to link a subdomain to a domain\
MX - Info about mail servers\
TXT - Stores human readable text notes\
NS - Name servers\
SOA - Stores admin information about a domain\
SRV - Specifies ports for specific services\
PTR - Pointer to a domain name; used for reverse-lookups\

### Enumeration
Nmap can be used to enumerate the domain name


### Zone Transfers
Zone transfers occur over TCP port 53, if it is open there is a chance that you can get a zone transfer to work. A lot of import information can be retrieved by a zone transfer.

`dig axfr <ip-or-hostname> @<domain_name>`

- ce a transfer is complete, you can add the name server to `/etc/resolv.conf` for easy browsing of domain resources
