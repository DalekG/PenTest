# Port 21 - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

FTP is a plain text file transfer service that allows file transfers between hosts

### Enumeration
Nmap scripts `-sC or --script` can do a good job of enumerating FTP. If you don't want to wait on the full -sC, use `--script ftp-*`

### Anonymous Login
Anonymous FTP allows for users to use the FTP server without an assigned userID or a password. Anonymous FTP login may not always show all of the files all the server, since a selection can be made viewable for general access.

If anonymous login is enabled try these:

From the command line -
```
$ ftp <ipaddress>
$ anonymous
$ anonymous
```
Access should be granted and you can browse around

From a web browser -\
`ftp://anonymous:anonymous@<ipaddress>`

### FTP Commands
`HELP` - Tells the user what commands are available\
`PORT 127,0,0,1,0,80` - Will tell the server to connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 80. The 6th must be a zero and the port represented by decimal or the 5th and 6th can represent the port in hex.\

`GET` - Will pull a file from the remote machine to the local\
