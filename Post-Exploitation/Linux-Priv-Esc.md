# Linux Privilege Escalation

## Sudo privilege
Sudo (Super User Do root task), allows user accounts to use elivated access to run commands. The sudoers file located in /etc/ gives permissions to use sudo for different users located on the system.

After gaining user level access on a machine you can run the command listed below to check for sudo permissions for the user you are logged in as:
```sudo -l```

If the user is allowed to execute commands with 'sudo', you can su (substitute user) to gain 'root' access:
```sudo su```
