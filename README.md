## Pentest Notes

This repo is a collaboration of notes that we (ByteMyBit) have come up with through penetration tests of capture-the-flag events.

[Methodology](https://github.com/DalekG/PenTest/tree/main/Methodology) - Description of the phases of pentesting\
[Post-Exploitation](https://github.com/DalekG/PenTest/tree/main/Post-Exploitation) - Post-Exploitation tips and tricks\
[Tools&Links](https://github.com/DalekG/PenTest/tree/main/Tools%26Links) - Lists of tools and training links that we have found useful\
[Network&Services Exploits](https://github.com/DalekG/PenTest/tree/main/Network%26Service%20Exploits) - Examples and tips for exploiting common services\
[Web Exploits](https://github.com/DalekG/PenTest/tree/main/Web%20Exploits) - Web exploitation tips and tricks\

Actively conducting penetration tests and participating in CTFs allow us to keep the repo up-to-date as best as possible
